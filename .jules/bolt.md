## 2024-10-24 - Fused QKV Attention Projection
**Learning:** In a CausalSelfAttention implementation with separate c_q, c_k, and c_v linear projections, kernel launch overhead and memory bandwidth utilization can be slightly improved by fusing them into a single `c_qkv` projection.
**Action:** Always look to fuse separate, identically-sized parallel linear operations applied to the same tensor input (especially Q, K, V attention projections) into a single larger projection, splitting the result afterwards.
